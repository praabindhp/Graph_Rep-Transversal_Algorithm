# Graph_Rep-Transversal_Algorithm
C Program For Traversal Algorithm In Graphical Representation

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

This Is A C Program To Illustrate The Traversal Algorithm In Graphical Representation

The Operations Illustrated :

	1. Breadth First Search
	
	2. Depth First Search
	
The User Will Be Prompted For :
	
	1. Entering The Number Of Vertices
	
	2. The Adjacency Matrix
	
	3. Entering Your Choice
  
    A. 1 For BFS
    
    B. 2 For DFS
	
  4. Do You Want To Continue
  
    A. Y For Yes
    
    B. N For No

The GCC File Has Also Been Pushed For Reference

Unlike tree traversal, graph traversal may require that some vertices be visited more than once, since it is not necessarily known before transitioning to a vertex that it has already been explored. As graphs become more dense, this redundancy becomes more prevalent, causing computation time to increase; as graphs become more sparse, the opposite holds true.
