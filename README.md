# Graph_Rep-Transversal_Algorithm
C Program For Traversal Algorithm In Graphical Representation

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
